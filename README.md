This project was mainly taken to reduce human work on silly tasks and promote automation, the robot is wholly based on vision, unlike other automatic moving robots, it uses its main camera for movement, obstacle detection and corner detection. This is possible by analyzing the camera data that is pixel data where Tensorflow comes under picture and for the path detection, the lanes are identified using the image library of python that is OpenCV.  The obtained simulation values and output are mentioned in the Product URL and the project is still ongoing.
